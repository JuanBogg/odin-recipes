        <h3><em>Ingredients</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 extra large zucchini, halved lengthwise</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 sweet onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic</li>
            <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        </ul>
        <p><h3><em>Steps</em></h3></p>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li></p>
            <p><li>Use a melon baller to separate and remove seeds and pulp separately from the zucchini, carving out each half and leaving about a half-inch shell. Chop zucchini pulp into pieces about 1/4 inch in diameter. Discard seeds.</li></p>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, about 5 minutes. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Add ground lamb; continue to cook and stir until lamb is lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
                    <li> Stir chopped zucchini into the lamb mixture. Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer mixture until the zucchini is hot, about 3 minutes. Drain excess grease. Season lamb mixture with coarse salt and black pepper.</li>
            </li>
        </ol>
