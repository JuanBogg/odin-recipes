        <p><li><strong> Make the filling</strong>: Mix the filling ingredients together and set aside. </li></p>
        <li><strong>Make the sauce</strong> Cook the garlic and pesto in oil, stir in the heavy cream, and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer, then whisk in the Parmesan.</li>
        <p><li><strong>Assemble the ravioli</strong>: Roll out the dough into sheets. Drop cheese filling onto the dough about an inch apart. <p>Cover with the top sheet of pasta and make a seal around each portion of filling. Cut out individual ravioli, then seal the edges.</li></p>
        <li><strong>Cook and bake the ravioli</strong> Boil the ravioli in salted water until the dumplings rise to the top and the filling is hot. Drain well.</li>
        <p><li><strong>Serve the ravioli</strong>: Divide the ravioli between bowls, top with the warmed marinara sauce, then finish with the sauce. </li></p>
